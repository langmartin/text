* The Power of Two Random Choices
** The Paper

- Introduction explains the motivation and technique
- Discussion of mathmatical strategies for evaluating ball & bin
  routing problems to equip future researchers
- Reviews of proofs

** Balls in Buckets

- Selecting a bucket at random makes the largest bucket
  $\log n/\log\log n$
- Pick two buckers, and choose the emptier bucket. The largest bucket
  is now $\log \log n/\log 2 + \Theta(1)$
- 2 is $d$ in general, more random choices provide a linear
  improvement, but the big reduction in size is accomplished by two
  choices

** Hashing

- Hash table maps the value of the hashing function for the key to a
  list of colliding results (chain)
- Hash by two random functions, choose the shortest chain

** Shared Memory Emulations on DMMs

- Hashing memory addresses distributed across the cluster
- Historically, one of the first applications

** Load Balancing with Limited Information

- Load information can be expensive and unavailable
- Static :: balls are added to buckets
- Dynamic :: balls are also removed from buckets sometimes

Dynamic case models load balancing, and complicates the math

** Low Congestion Circuit Routing

- Witness tree technique with explict histories of \vec v$ insertions
  and $\vec w$ deletions, applied alternately (just to limit balls in
  play)
- Sticky; if a $v_i$ has been routed to a bin before, it's placed in
  the least loaded of the two bins selected the first time
- Pruned to unique bins and mappings of balls to bin choices
- Rebalancing provides no extra benefit
- Proof that in general this is the best we can do for maximum load
