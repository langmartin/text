#+TITLE: What Goes Around Comes Around

* Intro

:END:

- Data model proposals come along regularly
- Often without benefit of hindsight (2020)
- Hence, 35 years of "progress", what should we learn
- Predictions about XML

* Epochs
:PROPERTIES:
:data-background: img/lawn.jpg
:data-state: blur
:END:

- Hierarchical (IMS): late 1960's and 1970's
- Network (CODASYL): 1970's
- Relational: 1970's and early 1980's Entity-Relationship: 1970's
- Extended Relational: 1980's
- Semantic: late 1970's and 1980's
- Object-oriented: late 1980's and early 1990's
- Object-relational: late 1980's and early 1990's

* Meta Lessons

:END:

- Me: we end making these design tradeoffs in applications
- The market decides, not always wisely

* Terms
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

- Physical data independence: the ability to change unindexed data
  storage (like order of records) and run programs written for the old
  data storage layer
- Logical independence: add fields to db records, exlude them for a view

* Hierarchical
:PROPERTIES:
:data-background: img/big-key.jpg
:data-state: blur
:END:

** IMS
- Physical and logical data independence are highly desirable
- Tree structured data models are very restrictive
- It is hard to logically reorganize tree structured data
- Record-at-a-time is hard to hand optimize

* Network
:PROPERTIES:
:data-background: img/bunch-keys.jpg
:data-state: blur
:END:

** CODASYL

- Networks are more flexible than hierarchies but more complex
- Less physically and logically independent
- Loading and recovering networks is harder than hierarchies
  (broken pointers)

* The Great Debate
:PROPERTIES:
:data-background: img/duel.jpg
:data-state: blur
:END:

- Relational, set-at-a-time high level languages
- CODASYL is too complex to be good
- Record-at-a-time is too hard to optimize

vs.

- COBOL programmers can't understand new things
- Anyway, set languages can be built on CODASYL

* Relational
:PROPERTIES:
:data-background: img/rustic-table.jpg
:data-state: blur
:END:

- Set-a-time languages are good, regardless of the data model, since
  they offer much improved physical data independence
- Logical data independence is easier with a simple data model than
  with a complex one
- Query optimizers can beat all but the best record-at-a-time DBMS
  application programmers
- The market: VAX vs mainframe

* Entity-Relationship
:PROPERTIES:
:data-background: img/straw-arrows.jpg
:data-state: blur
:END:

- Introduced without a query language, but boxes & arrows
- Used in schema design tools
- Alternative: normalization
- Functional dependencies are too hard

* R++
:PROPERTIES:
:data-background: img/table-with-stuff.jpg
:data-state: blur
:END:

- Relation + this one thing to solve a problem
- e.g. Gem
  - set values
  - foreign key cascaded dot reference
  - generalization via inheritance
- Unless there is a big performance or functionality advantage, new constructs will go nowhere

* Semantic
:PROPERTIES:
:data-background: img/kitchen-sink.jpg
:data-state: blur
:END:

- Attribute that's a set of records in other classes =country.ships => {}=
- Inverse attributes =ship.country_of_registration=
- Multiple inheritance
- Too easy to simulate on relational systems
- Big vendors focused on transactional performance

* Object Oriented
:PROPERTIES:
:data-background: img/cuneiform.jpg
:data-state: blur
:END:

- Motivated by the ORM "impedance mismatch"
- Embedded == limited to the language. Expertise doesn't transfer
- O2 embedded an HLL. Sadly, French
- Packages will not sell to users unless they are in "major pain"
- Persistent langauges need support of the programming language community

* Object Relational

- Motivated by Ingress working on GIS queries
- The major benefits of OR is two-fold. putting code in the data base (and thereby bluring the distinction between code and data) and user-defined access methods.
- Widespread adoption of new technology requires either standards and/or an elephant pushing hard.

* XML Predictions

17. Schema-last is a probably a niche market
18. XQuery is pretty much OR SQL with a different syntax
19. XML will not solve the semantic heterogeneity either inside or outside the enterprise.
